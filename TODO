  - if you target a missile right next to yourself it shoots to the end
    of the screen but then still blows up next to you

  - queuing dirt
    - need a way to break out of the queue?


- - - - - - GAME MECHANICS - - - - - -
  - make turret more satisfying to shoot
    - faster fire rate
    - recoil
    - burst fire, crosshair goes away?
  - separate palette for upgrades
    - fire rate
    - bullet damage
    - turret turn rate
    - missile radius
    - fire multiple projectiles in an arc
  - upgrades:
    - turn rate doesn't work well
    - need stronger enemies too
    - ticker placement needs to be better/readable names


- - - - - - - PLAYTESTING - - - - - - - -
  - dragging bullet crosshair is kind of hard to aim
  - ticker to tell player to tap to aim
  - when a missile collides and hits something, don't move the explosion to targetPos
  - have enemies attack from only one side at a time at first?
